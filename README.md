# MPI-with-Nonideal-Selection-Fields

This project explores the impact of non-ideal selection fields on Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) using superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIOs). MPI relies on the nonlinear magnetization response of SPIOs at a field-free point (FFP) for high-resolution imaging. The study investigates two non-ideal selection field conditions: a shifted selection field center and an inhomogeneous field gradient. X-space reconstruction was employed to analyze the resulting artifacts under these nonideal conditions. Simulations using MATLAB were performed on phantom datasets, including point source and vasculature models. Evaluation metrics such as Full-Width-Half-Maximum (FWHM) and displacement resolution were used to quantify image degradation. Results showed that non-ideal selection fields introduce geometric warping, resolution loss, and positional shifts in the reconstructed images.
